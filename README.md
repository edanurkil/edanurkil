About Me

I am currently pursuing a degree in Software Engineering, where I am developing a strong foundation in core areas such as Java programming, CISCO networking, cybersecurity and more. While I am still exploring the breadth of this major, I am passionate about technology and eager to learn new concepts and skills.

I hold various certifications, including CISCO certifications, TSC certifications, and language proficiency credentials. I believe in continuous learning and am committed to expanding my knowledge and capabilities within the tech field.

Connect with me on LinkedIn to follow my journey and explore collaborative opportunities.
